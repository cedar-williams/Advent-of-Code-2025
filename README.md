# Advent-of-Code-2025

## Day 1
Part 1 was pleasantly easy, but part 2 was not...  I was plagued with so many off-by-one errors that I ended up just making a function to step through a virtual number by number turning of the dial and counting the 0 hits.

## Day 2
Part 1 was again easy, but part 2 had a PEBCAK.  I didn't understand that when they said "at least twice" they meant at least twice so didn't take in to account single digit numbers in my test case.

## Day 3
I'm learning I should be trying to make these solutions modular on part 1 since part 2 seems to be adjusting my solution to select for n somethings every time.  But it was easier this time. This time I went directly to a scratch pad and worked out the logic first and then implemented it.
